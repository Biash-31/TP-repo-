# Representation of an Image using a Python Class

## This code aims to create a Python class in order to represent an image.

The image consists of either 1-channel(intensity) or 3-channels(RGB) with values ranging from 0-255 and image size being 640x480px.
Polymorphism is used to create constructors to specify whether the image is in black and white or color.
Additionally, a copy function is defined which returns a new image with the same content yet different address.
